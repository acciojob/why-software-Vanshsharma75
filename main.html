<h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
	<p>Because, mein nahi toh kaun??</p>
	<p>I mean, it's not like I've always wanted to become one. When I was a child I used to look at books and their authors, read fascinating poems and think about how could a poet create such beautiful lines, how can a person make a boring language sound so interesting with sheer creativity. And later on while playing PC games my elder brother told me some one wrote that game using computer language anf I kept thinking about it while writing little poems for my school. And dreamt that maybe oneday I would also write a game.</p>
